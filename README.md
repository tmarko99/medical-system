# Medical System

Medical system app allows us to create a medical organization that will be responsible for
doctors and patients with their examinations. Every doctor belongs to the organization and can
treat only patients which also belong to the same organization. The patient has one primary doctor
which has to have the title of doctor of medicine. During the creation of the examination, we need to specify
an organization where an examination will be executed, a patient who will get treatment and one or more
doctors responsible to cure a patient. On the dashboard page, we are able to see charts with data about
the number of patients and doctors for each organization, and the average number of patients by gender.
